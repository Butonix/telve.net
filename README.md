## Features

You can browse and submit links to content on the Internet or post your own originals. Other people can vote on the links or text you post, highlighting the links will be placed on the home page. You can also comment on the links or text you post and reply to other reviewers.

### Notes

Requires a LAMP stack with PHP version 5.3.10 (Ubuntu 12.04) because it's using CodeIgniter version 3.1.2 web framework.

Don't forget to replace database credentials under `application/config/database.php` and import the SQL dump located under `db/` directory.

### Requirements

* [Vesta CP](https://vestacp.com/#install)
